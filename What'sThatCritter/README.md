What'sThatCritter is an application that I am currently working on. 
In a nutshell, someone with a phone will take a picture of an animal,
the picture is sent to a server, then a mxnet based image classifier will
determine what the animal in the picture is and send a brief description and 
name back to the phone.

What'sThatCritter is still in the design process, but the current design
outline can be seen in the design document. Currently, I am learning how to
use mxnet as well as learning the ins and outs of cloud computing.
